Amigo is a hotfix library which can hotfix almost everything for your app.

## Usage
In your project's `build.gradle`

```groovy
dependencies {
  classpath 'me.ele:amigo:0.3.0'
}
```
In your module's `build.gradle`

```
 apply plugin: 'me.ele.amigo'
```

you are good to go now, as simple as this.

## Demo
There is a app module sub project. And there is an Demo page in the app demonstrating how to apply patch apk. Please ref the usage.

## Development
#### Process
There are two gradle tasks provided in the app/build.gradle, `:app:runHost`, `:app:preparePatch`, which can accelerate development.

* `./gradlew runHost`, launch the host app
* `./gradlew preparePatch`, build and push the patch apk to the device
* apply the patch apk in the Demo page

#### Gradle plugin
The plugin was put into buildSrc directory, which means the plugin code change will work immediately each time you build.

#### amigo lib
The gradle plugin would select right amigo lib automatically. In the development mode, the amigo-lib module will be used.

## notice

* Instant Run conflicts with Amigo, so disable Instant Run when used with amigo

#### to make hotfix work
There are two ways to make hotfix work.

* if you don't need hotfix work immediately

	you just need to download new apk file to /data/data/{your pkg}/files/amigo/demo.apk,
	when app restarts next time, hotfix apk will be loaded as fresh as new.

	```java
    Amigo.workLater(context, patchApkFile);
    ```

* work immediately, app will restart immediately

	```java
	Amigo.work(context, patchApkFile);
	```

### disable working patch apk

```java
Amigo.tagClearPatch(context);
```
**note**：When the main process is restarted the host apk will be used and all patch files will be deleted.


## customize the fix layout
some time-tense operation is handled in a new process with an activity, you may customize it

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="amigo_layout"
    android:value="{your-layout-name}" />

<meta-data
    android:name="amigo_theme"
    android:value="{your-theme-name}" />

```

## limitations
 - new added `service` & `provider` is not supported for now

 - app launcher activity's name cannot be changed
 
 - `RemoteViews`'s layout change in `notification` & `widget`is not support 
 
 - may conflict with google play terms
 
 - **the only limit is your imagination**

play with demo
----

if you try to experience Amigo's magic, you can integrate with your own app as you like;
also you can play with this app demo following the procedures below.

   1. ./gradlew clean assembleRelease & adb install .../build/outputs/apk/app-release.apk
   2. change code wherever you like & ./gradlew clean assembleRelease
   3. adb push .../build/outputs/apk/app-release.apk /sdcard/demo.apk
   4. click the "apply patch apk" button, and see the changes you made then.
   
## retrieve hotfix file

- make it simple, you just need a fully new apk

- for user's network traffic's sake, you may just want to download a diff file
  [bspatch](https://github.com/eleme/bspatch) is an option for you
