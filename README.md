Amigo is a hotfix library which can fix everything for your Android app

## How to use 
### Download
In your project's `build.gradle`

```groovy
buildscript { 
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    
    dependencies {
        classpath 'me.ele:amigo:0.6.0-beta'
    }
}
```

In your module's `build.gradle`

```groovy
apply plugin: 'me.ele.amigo'

android {
...
}

//if you don't want use amigo in dev
//you can define this extension in your mybuild.gradle as to distinguish debug & release build
amigo {
    disable true //default false
}

```


### Compatibility

- Supports All Devices From ECLAIR `2.1` to Nougat `7.1`
- Even support next Android version, no matter small or big change. So Cool, Aha :v:
- Android 3.0 isn't supported

### Customize loading page
Some time-consuming tasks are handled in a separate process to avoid ANR, you can customize the loading activity by add the follow code into your AndroidManifest.xml:

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="amigo_layout"
    android:value="{your-layout-name}" />

<meta-data
    android:name="amigo_theme"
    android:value="{your-theme-name}" />
```

### Make hotfix work
There are two ways to make hotfix work.

* if you don't need hotfix work immediately
 
  you just need to download new apk file, hotfix apk will be loaded as fresh as new when app restarts next time
	
	```java
    Amigo.workLater(context, patchApkFile, callback);
    ```
    
* work immediately, App will restart immediately
	
	```java
	Amigo.work(context, patchApkFile);
	```
	
### Remove patch

```java
Amigo.clear(context);
```
    
**note**：All patch files would be deleted on the next start up.

## Demo
And there is an Demo page in the app demonstrating how to apply patch apk.
Run the task `./gradlew runHost preparePatch`, and navigate to the `demo` page.

## Development

### Amigo gradle plugin
The plugin was put into buildSrc directory, which means the plugin code change will work immediately each time you build.

### Amigo lib
The amigo plugin will select the right amigo lib automatically.

### Run tests
There are two gradle tasks provided in the app/build.gradle, `:app:runHost`, `:app:preparePatch`, which can accelerate development.

* `./gradlew runHost`, launch the host app
* `./gradlew preparePatch`, build and push the patch apk to the device
* apply the patch apk in the Demo page

## Limits
 - have to change the way using a content provider
    * declare a new provider: the authorities string must start with "**${youPackageName}.provider**"
    
        ```xml
        <provider
            android:name="me.ele.demo.provider.StudentProvider"
            android:authorities="${youPackageName}.provider.student" />
        ```
        
    * change the uri used to do the query, insert, delete operations:
     
        ```java
        // 1. inside your app process, no modifications need:
        Cursor cursor = getContentResolver().query(Uri.parse("content://" + getPackageName() + ".provider.student?id=0"), null, null, null, null);
        // 2. in another process, have to change the authorities uri like the following : 
        Cursor cursor = getContentResolver().query(Uri.parse("content://" + targetPackageName + ".provider/student?id=0"), null, null, null, null);
        ```
        
 -  Instant Run conflicts with Amigo, so disable Instant Run when used with amigo
 
 -  Amigo doesn't support Honeycomb `3.0`
    * Android 3.0 is a version with full of bugs, & Google has closed Android 3.0 Honeycomb.
    
 - `RemoteViews`'s layout change in `notification` & `widget`is not support   
    * any resource id in here should be used with ```java RCompat.getHostIdentifier(Context context, int id) ```

## Retrieve hotfix file

- make it simple, you just need a fully new apk

- to save the internet traffic, you may just want to download a diff file
  [bspatch](https://github.com/eleme/bspatch) (`support whole apk diff & fine-grained diff in apk`)is an option for you
